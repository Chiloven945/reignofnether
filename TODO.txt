Wave Survival 0.5a
------------------

[❌] Update to 1.0.11 full release

[🟡] Time now begins at dusk on the first day
    - This means day 1 is no longer half the length of other days
[❌] Ranged ground units should target the nearest unit


Features
--------
[❌] Configurable Unit Costs (Thanks to @DoodleNoodles)
    - Includes all costs, population values and build times
    - Modify the files generated at configs/reignofnether-config.toml to adjust them
    - If the server config is adjusted, this will be enforced for all players joining the match

[❌] Shift queueing movements and buildings (not just placement)
    - Add index to sendCommand packets
    - Add recursive field to UnitActionItem: nextActionItem
        - OR just add a list queue to each unit
    - Add end detections in goals for when to move to nextActionItem
    - Add clientside checkpoints

    [❌] Only apply to build/repair and move
    [❌] Detect idle attackers
    [❌] Detect workers as idle faster
    [❌] If queued and slowQueue does NOT contain any items for that user, reset the unit's behaviours first
    [❌] if !queued, clear that unit's slowQueue

Bugfixes
--------
[✔] Fixed issue of your units sometimes showing other players' movement indicators
