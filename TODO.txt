Bugfixes

- Fixed slimes/cubes taking damage when consuming other slimes/cubes
- Autocasting consume no longer looks for tiny slimes (because they won't increase size, only heal slightly)
- Fixed the bloodlust tooltip incorrectly stating a 50% movement speed increase (it's actually 20%)
- Recoloured tridents to fit the piglin colour scheme
- changed /gamerule groundYLevel to be the minimum camera height instead of the locked height, and default is now 0
- fixed /gamerule improvedPathfinding not working for some new units
- added /gamerule flyingMaxYLevel (default 320) to limit the height of flying units like ghasts
